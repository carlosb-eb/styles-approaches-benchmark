# Goal

Create a EventCard component with different technologies (css-modules, post-css, sass, styled-components, tailwind css, vanilla extract, windi css). Create a styles architecture for each option using a Theme with shared style variables/design tokens. 2 Themes: dark and light.

The styles should have component scope and don't affect other ones.

# Benchmark

- Compile time / Dev experience
- Bundle CSS size
- Usage complexity / learning curve
- Compenhension velocity / legibility
- Styles composability
